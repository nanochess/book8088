ERRATA FOR THE BOOK: (Aug/31/2020)

Even though all my efforts, Craig Turner found a pair of mistakes on the
instruction set appendix.

The instructions 0x9a and 0xea have inverted operands. The correct representation is:

    CALL 0x5566:0x7788      9a 88 77 66 55
    JMP 0x5566:0x7788       ea 88 77 66 55

This same mistake slipped into my sequel book.

James Cross found a small difference in sieve.asm between the book and the Git,
also a small bug on page 28, where the byte count shown is 123 instead of 121.

Daniel @netsurf916 found a small bug in page 55, bullet 5, last word says "if direction flag is zero" instead of the correct "if direction flag is one".


NOTES:

If you found this Git for accident, do you need more details on the inner workings? 

These programs are fully commented in my new book Programming Boot Sector Games and
also you'll find a 8086/8088 crash course!
